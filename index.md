## 🅿️ Parking

It is possible to park about 50 meters before the location, on the left side after the plant nursery. If that spot is taken, there is another parking spot 50 meters after the location, near a green fence, on the right side.

## 👣 Getting to the dome

1. Look for a small sign on a wooden board that says **Mayana**
2. Go down the stairs on the right of the sign
3. Pass through the iron gate. *Cool lock, right?*
4. Go down the stairs
5. At the first fork in the path, turn right and immediately left
6. Do you see a bit of the dome in front of you?
7. Go down the wooden pallet stairs and the Dome will be in front of you

## 🧭 Hikes in the area

## 👟 Hikes in Amirim

All around and inside the moshav, there are a few marked hiking trails. You can choose the length and intensity of the hike, and take both a walk around the area and in the surrounding nature

![**The Dome is at the marked ❌**](Doma%2019ccc0815be84f789ff2804f68c27570/51dfe158-1757-458b-9f86-4afa55b5a077.png)

**The Dome is at the marked ❌**

Two gorgeous viewpoints just a few steps from the dome

**📍 “The plane” viewpoint**

## 🏞️ Parod river

The Parod river is a seasonal river that flows after rainfalls. A great place for hiking or doing a picnic.

 **📍  Parking (option 1) -** you will find here some tables and places to sit

[Merom HaGalil Regional Council](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dF7XCoVRbsHwodo37)

 **📍 Parking (option 2)** - hike down along the stream, less tables to sit but more nature. (This is more quiet and beautiful in my opinion)
